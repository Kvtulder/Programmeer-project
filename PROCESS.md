## day 2

### Design
Starting to implement the design. I found out that the proposed pie chart library (Any chart for android) is'nt free. So im currently looking for alternatives. Currently looking at MPAndroidChart.

### API

I just found out that the ING api might not be as open as the website suggests. In the FAQ it says you need to be registered as AISP, but i can't find any information online on how to register. 
I'm also stuck on connection to the API, I'm getting an unexpected error. If i can't fix it today I'll contact the ING

If it becomes sure that I can't connect to the API, I'll switch to an importable CSV file. The user can download it from the ING online banking enviorment.
